*LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle

--?? If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T 
   such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior
   of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.??

-- Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must 
   be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
